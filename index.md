I am interested in writing essays on subjects I am trying to learn. My interested are broad and the essays here would be a way to make sense of the mess I have made of my learning opportunities. 

Hopefully, I have more to say on this in future. I have written a few till a few policy-based newsletters on substack and I wrote two technical how-to guides on WordPress. I have linked them below for reference along with my LinkedIn and a bibliography of a publication I contributed. 

1. LinkedIn - [Roshan Mishra's Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roshan-mishra/)
2. Subsack - Newshastra available on [www.newshastra.com](https://www.newshastra.com)
3. My WordPress Blog  is available on [roshanmishra.wordpress.com](https://roshanmishra.wordpress.com)

I will update this website in future and keep it as a learning resource.
