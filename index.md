I am interested in writing essays on subjects I am trying to learn. My interested are broad and the essays here would be a way to make sense of the mess I have made of my learning opportunities. 

Hopefully, I have more to say on this in future. I have written a few policy-based newsletters on substack. I plan to publish one every weekend.I wrote two semi-technical how-to guides on WordPress one for myself on how to set up aws wordpress and another A teacher training guide. I have linked them below for reference along with my LinkedIn and a bibliography of a publication I contributed. That's it for now.
